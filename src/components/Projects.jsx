      description: "Tayseer-ul-Faraiz is a fully offline, multilingual mobile app developed using React Native, Expo, NativeWind, and i18n to simplify the complex process of Islamic inheritance distribution. Designed to assist users who may struggle with mathematical calculations, the app reduces what typically takes 1â€“2 hours to just 5â€“15 minutes with an intuitive, user-friendly interface. With just one button click, users can calculate inheritance shares by simply entering the number of heirs. The app clearly shows the distribution breakdown and the reasoning behind it, making Islamic inheritance accessible and understandable to all. Arabic support is also planned for future updates. ðŸ“± 500+ downloads across 13 countries, empowering communities with accessible tech.",

It allows club heads to request events, which HODs approve, making them visible college-wide. The system features room management and faculty-driven attendance tracking to monitor student participation. Students with frequent absences are automatically blacklisted, with an option to appeal. Advanced SQL techniques, including 3NF normalization, JOINs, nested queries, triggers, and procedures, ensure efficient data handling and smooth functionality.",

Customers can scan a QR code after shopping to join an online queue, where they wait for their turn while freeing up their time. Once it's their turn, they make an online payment and can collect their items later at their convenience. This system reduces idle time spent in queues and streamlines the payment process.",
